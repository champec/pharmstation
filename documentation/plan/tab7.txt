## Custom Features Summary

### Handover Notes — Canvas Whiteboard

- Canvas-based board with virtual sticky notes
- Click to add note, drag to move, resize
- Priority colours (red/amber/green or similar)
- Assign to staff member, set due date
- Mark done, delete
- Filters at top: Today / Overdue / Mine / Unassigned / By person / By date
- Library options: build custom with HTML5 Canvas, or use something lightweight — we can decide when we get there

### Printing — Certificate

- A4 template (portrait or landscape, we decide on design)
- Fixed design, only dynamic fields are name and GPhC registration number
- Needs a print-to-PDF library

For this I'd suggest **react-to-print** — it's tiny (3kb), no dependencies, just renders a React component to the browser's native print dialog. You design the certificate as a React component with print-specific CSS (`@media print`), call `window.print()`, done. The user can print or save as PDF natively. No heavy PDF generation library needed.

```typescript
// Simplified concept
function RPCertificate({ name, gphcNumber }) {
  return (
    <div className="certificate">
      {/* Your designed template */}
      <h1>Responsible Pharmacist</h1>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>GPhC: {gphcNumber}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

// Print it
const handlePrint = useReactToPrint({ contentRef: certificateRef })
```

### Printing — Logs & Registers

This is the bigger one. Whatever is on screen needs to print cleanly on A4.

Same approach — **`@media print` CSS** handles most of it:

```css
/* print.module.css */

@media print {
  /* Hide everything except the table */
  .sideNav, .topNav, .rightPanel,
  .filterBar, .pagination, .actionButtons {
    display: none;
  }

  /* Table fills the page */
  .registerTable {
    width: 100%;
    font-size: 11px;
  }

  /* Page setup */
  @page {
    size: A4 landscape;  /* or portrait — user chooses */
    margin: 15mm;
  }

  /* Page breaks between pages of data */
  .registerTable tr {
    page-break-inside: avoid;
  }

  /* Header repeats on every printed page */
  .registerTable thead {
    display: table-header-group;
  }

  /* Print header with pharmacy details + date */
  .printHeader {
    display: block;  /* hidden on screen, visible in print */
  }
}

@media screen {
  .printHeader {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

The key points:

- **No PDF library needed** — browser print handles A4 layout natively
- **`@media print` CSS** — hides nav/filters/buttons, shows only the table + a print header
- **Print header** — hidden on screen, appears in print with pharmacy name, register name, date range, printed by
- **Portrait or landscape** — user picks via a print settings toggle before printing, we set `@page { size: }` accordingly
- **`thead` repeats** — column headers appear on every printed page automatically
- **Page breaks** — `page-break-inside: avoid` on rows so entries don't split across pages
- **Print all or print filtered** — whatever is currently displayed (filtered/paginated) is what prints, or a "Print All" option fetches everything and renders a hidden full table for printing
- **react-to-print** handles triggering it cleanly

So the stack for printing is just:

```
react-to-print     → 3kb, triggers browser print dialog
@media print CSS   → Your own print styles
Browser native     → Handles A4, PDF save, actual printing
```

No heavy libraries. The browser's built-in print engine is surprisingly good at A4 layout when you give it clean CSS.
